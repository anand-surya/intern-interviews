      <h2>About Me</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="text">
      <p> My name is Anand Surya Rajasrinivasan, graduate student at Rochester Institute of Technology. I'm looking for
      internship oppurtunities to hone my web development skills by working on real world projects. I have experience
        developing few websites and mobile applications. Last summer I worked as a Research Assistant in the Machine
      Learning Laboratory at my university developing deep learning model for Kodak Alaris. I learnt a new technology
      in a short period and delivered highly efficient models. So, I am comfortable exploring new technologies and giving my best. </p>

      <p>I started coding when I was in my 8th grade, I wanted to understand how computers work. Then I took Computer
      Engineering in my bachelors. I participated in various hackathon and met people who were experts from various fields in software
        development. Seeing them, I wanted to learn more about software development and specialise in web development
        before taking a job. I am currently enrolled in a graduate degree. I would like to develop software which would
        help the mankind, ease their work. For me the best software I created till date was an mobile application for visually impaired
        people which is fully voice controlled to give access to their study materials.
